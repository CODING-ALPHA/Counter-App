# Counter App

- This Counter App is a simple project that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to increment or decrement a number by clicking either the "+" or "-" buttons and reset the counter back to default using the "Reset" button.

## Features

- Increment and Decrement: Click the “+” button to increase the number by 1 and the “-” button to decrease it.
- Reset: The “Reset” button sets the counter back to its initial value "0".
- DOM Manipulation: Demonstrates basic DOM manipulation techniques.

## Installation

- Clone this repository to your local Computer: git clone https://github.com/CODING-ALPHA/Counter-App.git .
- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- Open the app in your browser.
- Click the “+” button to increase the number.
- Click the “-” button to decrease the number.
- Click the "Reset" button to reset the counter back to default.
